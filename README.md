# Headwind A339X - A330-900neo

Welcome to the Headwind A339X Project! This is a open source project to create a free Airbus A330-900neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator and is mainly based on the FlyByWire A32NX. If you only want to use the aircraft in MSFS please download the Addon here: https://flightsim.to/file/18198/airbus-a330-900neo-conversion

## How to build
Make sure docker are isntalled. Prefferably with WSL2 backend.

#### 1. First, run following command on powershell. This will install the A32NX docker images and node modules.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/setup.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/setup.sh
```
#### 2. As next step we will copy the original source files and copy-over our source files.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/copy.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/copy.sh
```

#### 3. Build all A32NX module by running following command on powershell. 

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/build.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/build.sh
```

#### 4. The package is now ready to use. Copy the folder "headwind-aircraft-a330-900" to your CommunityPackage folder in MSFS.

#### (Optional) If you want to use the MSFS Dev Tools you can run the following command (after build completed) to copy the files to the PackageSources.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/package.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/package.sh
```
