Welcome to the Headwind Simulations A339X Project! This is a open source project to create a free Airbus A330-900neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator and is based on the FlyByWire System A32NX. If you only want to use the aircraft in MSFS please download the Addon here: https://headwindsim.net/a339x.html

### A330neo

 ```
 Model       A330-941
 Engine      RR TRENT 7000
 APU         GTCP331-350C
 FMS         Honeywell Release P5A
 FWC Std.    H2F9C
 RA          Honeywell ALA-52B
 TAWS        Honeywell EGPWS
 ACAS        Honeywell TPA-100B
 ATC         Honeywell TRA-67A
 MMR         Honeywell MMR
 WXR         Honeywell RDR-4000
 ```
The present aircraft setup is either being simulated or targeted. It's important to keep in mind that this setup could be altered in the future as the A339X initiative develops and transforms.


## How to build
Make sure docker are isntalled. Prefferably with WSL2 backend.

#### 1. First, run following command on powershell. This will install the A32NX docker images and node modules.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/setup.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/setup.sh
```
#### 2. As next step we will copy the original source files and copy-over our source files.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/copy.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/copy.sh
```

#### 3. Build all A32NX module by running following command on powershell.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/build_a339x.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/build_a339x.sh
```

#### 4. The package is now ready to use. Copy the folder "headwind-aircraft-a330-900" to your CommunityPackage folder in MSFS.

#### (Optional) If you want to use the MSFS Dev Tools you can run the following command (after build completed) to copy the files to the PackageSources.

For powershell:
```shell
.\scripts\dev-env\run.cmd ./scripts/package.sh
```
For Git Bash/Linux:
```shell
./scripts/dev-env/run.sh ./scripts/package.sh
```
